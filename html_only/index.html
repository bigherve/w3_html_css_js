            <h2 style="color: #065535;">Nine Suggestions on How to Get the Most Out of This Book</h2>


            <p>
                1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more important than any rule or technique. Unless you have this one fundamental requisite, a thousand rules on how to study will avail little,
                And if you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book.
                <strong>What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn</strong> , a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people. How can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself how
                important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: "My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend
                to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”
            </p>

            <p>
                2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird's-eye view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But don’t—unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you are reading because you want to increase your skill
                in human relations, <em>then go back and reread each chapter thoroughly</em>. In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.
            </p>

            <p>
                3. <mark> frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.</mark>
            </p>


            <p>
                4. Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in your hand.<ins> When you come across a suggestion that you feel you can use, draw a line beside it.</ins> If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore every sentence
                or highlight it, or mark it with “****.” Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly.
            </p>

                5. I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large insurance concern for fifteen years. Every month, she read all the insurance contracts her company had issued that month. Yes, she read many of the same contracts over month after month, year after
                year. Why? Because experience had taught her that that was the only way she could keep their provisions clearly in mind. I once spent almost two years writing a book on public speaking and yet I found I 21 had to keep going back over it
                from time to time in order to remember what I had written in my own book. The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing. So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don’t imagine that skimming through it once will
                suffice.
                <small>After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month,</small> Keep it on your desk in front of you every day. Glance through it often. Keep constantly impressing yourself with the rich possibilities
                for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember that the use of these principles can be made habitual only by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and application. There is no other way.
            </p>

            <p>
                6. Bernard Shaw once remarked: <del>“If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.”</del> Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are studying in this book, do
                something about them. Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don’t you will forget them quickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind. You will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the time. I know
                because I wrote the book, and yet frequently I found it difficult to apply everything I advocated. For example, when you are displeased, it is much easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try to understand the other person’s viewpoint.
                It is frequently easier to find fault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what you want than to talk about what the other person wants. And so on, So, as you read this book, remember that you are not merely trying to
                acquire information. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are attempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence and daily application. So refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook on
                human relations; and whenever you are confronted with some specific problem—such as handling a child, winning your spouse to your way of thinking, or satisfying an irritated customer—hesitate about doing the natural thing, the impulsive
                thing. This is usually wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you have underscored. Then try these new ways and watch them achieve magic for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you <abbr title="violating">slipping</abbr> a certain principle.<sub> Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.</sub>
            </p>

            <p>
                8. The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in a talk before 22 one of my classes, a highly efficient system he used for self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had become one of the most important financiers
                in America, and he confessed that he owed most of his success to the constant application of his homemade system. This is what he does, I’ll put it in his own words as accurately as I can remember: “For years I have kept an engagement
                book showing all the appointments I had during the day. My family never made any plans for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part of each Saturday evening to the illuminating process of self-examination and review
                and appraisal. After dinner I went off by myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the week. I asked myself: ‘What mistakes did I make that time?’‘What
                did I do that was right—and in what way could I have improved my performance?’ ‘What lessons can I learn from that experience?’ “I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was frequently astonished at my own blunders.
                Of course, as the years passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions. This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after year, did
                more for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted. “It helped me improve my ability to make decisions—and it aided me enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot recommend it too highly.” Why not use a similar system to
                check up on your application of the principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result. First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is both intriguing and priceless. Second, you will find that
                your ability to meet and deal with people will grow enormously.
            </p>

            <p>
                9. You will find at the end of this book several blank pages on which you should 23 record your triumphs in the application of these principles. Be specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a record will inspire you to greater efforts; and how
                fascinating these entries will be when you chance upon them some evening years from now! In order to get the most out of this book: a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations, b. Read each chapter twice
                before going on to the next one. c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion. d. Underscore each important idea. e. Review this book each month.
                <sup>f . Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a working handbook to help you solve your daily problems.</sup> g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he
                or she catches you violating one of these principles. h. Check up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future. i. Keep notes in the
                back of this book showing how and when you have applied these principles.

        <h2 style="color:#ee82ee">PART ONE Fundamental Techniques in Handling People</h2>

        <h3>1. “IF YOU WANT TO GATHER HONEY, DON’T KICK OVER THE BEEHIVE”</h3>

        <p>
           As Dr. Johnson said: “God Himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end
           of his days.”  Why should you and I? 
           <span>PRINCIPLE 1 - Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.</span>
        </p>

    <h3>2. DEALING WITH PEOPLE</h3>

    <p>
        Emerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way, In that, I learn of him.” If that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me? Let’s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure
        out the other person’s good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat
        them years after you have forgotten them.
        <span>PRINCIPLE 2 - Give honest and sincere appreciation.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>3. IF YOU DON’T DO THIS, YOU ARE HEADED FOR TROUBLE</h3>

    <p>
        When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it. Remember: “First, arouse in
        the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."

        <span>PRINCIPLE 3 - Arouse in the other person an eager want.</span>
    </p>

    <h2 id="part_two" style="color:#ee82ee">PART TWO Ways to Make People Like You</h2>

    <h3>1. DO THIS AND YOU’LL BE WELCOME ANYWHERE</h3>

    <p>
        If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this principle in mind.
        <span>PRINCIPLE 1 - Become genuinely interested in other people.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>2. A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION</h3>

    <p>
        THE VALUE OF A SMILE AT CHRISTMAS It costs nothing, but creates much. It enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those who give. It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever, None are so rich they can get along without
        it, and none so poor but are richer for its benefits. It creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business, and is the countersign of friends. It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and Nature’s
        best antidote fee trouble. Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is no earthly good to anybody till it is given away. And if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of our salespeople should be
        too tired to give you a smile, may we ask you to leave one of yours? For nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give!

        <span>PRINCIPLE 2 - Smile.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>3. IF YOU DON’T DO THIS, YOU ARE HEADED FOR TROUBLE</h3>

    <p>
        We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else. The name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others.
        The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual. From the waitress to the senior executive, the name will work magic as we deal with others.

        <span>PRINCIPLE 3 - Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and
            most important sound in any language.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>4. AN EASY WAY TO BECOME A GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST</h3>

    <p>
        So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments. Remember that the people
        you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person’s toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil
        on one’s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.

        <span>PRINCIPLE 4 - Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>5. HOW TO INTEREST PEOPLE</h3>

    <p>
        Talking in terms of the other person’s interests pays off for both parties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the field of employee communications, has always followed this principle. When asked what reward he got from it, Mr. Herzig responded that he not
        only received a different reward from each person but that in general the reward had been an enlargement of his life each time he spoke to someone.

        <span>PRINCIPLE 5 - Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>6. HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU INSTANTLY</h3>

    <p>
        There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into
        endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James said: “The deepest principle in human
        nature is the craving to be appreciated.” As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been responsible for civilization itself.

        <span>PRINCIPLE 6 - Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely.</span>
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ee82ee">PART THREE How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking</h2>

    <h3>1. YOU CAN’T WIN AN ARGUMENT</h3>

    <p>
        It was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued with my brother about everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied logic and argumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk
        about being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be shown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to write a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and
        watched the effect of thousands of arguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it . Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes
        and earthquakes. Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right. You can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you
        lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride.
        He will resent your triumph.

        <span>PRINCIPLE 1 - The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>2. A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIES—AND HOW TO AVOID IT</h3>

    <p>
        Two thousand years ago, Jesus said: “Agree with thine adversary quickly.” And 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice - advice that is sorely needed today. “Be diplomatic,” counseled the King. “It will
        help you gain your point.” In other words, don’t argue with your customer or your spouse or your adversary. Don’t tell them they are wrong, don’t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.

        <span>PRINCIPLE 2 - Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, "You're wrong.”</span>
    </p>

    <h3>3. IF YOU’RE WRONG, ADMIT IT</h3>

    <p>
        When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong—and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves—let’s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. Not only will that
        technique produce astonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more fun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself. Remember the old proverb: "By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.”

        <span>PRINCIPLE 3 - If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>4. A DROP OF HONEY</h3>

    <p>
        The sun vs wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said, "I'll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.” So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until
        it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him. Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped
        his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force. Aesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years before
        Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as they were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind; and kindliness, the friendly
        approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world. Remember what Lincoln said: “A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”

        <h3 style="color:#f00">Here I digress to remind everyone that Robert Lee was a bitch ass Ni**a</h3>

        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>
                <h4>Lee was a traitor</h4>
                <p>Robert Lee was the nation’s most notable traitor since Benedict Arnold. Like Arnold, Robert Lee had an exceptional record of military service before his downfall. Lee was a hero of the Mexican-American War and played a crucial role in
                    its final, decisive campaign to take Mexico City. But when he was called on to serve again—this time against violent rebels who were occupying and attacking federal forts—Lee failed to honor his oath to defend the Constitution. He
                    resigned from the United States Army and quickly accepted a commission in a rebel army based in Virginia. Lee could have chosen to abstain from the conflict—it was reasonable to have qualms about leading United States soldiers against
                    American citizens—but he did not abstain. He turned against his nation and took up arms against it. How could Lee, a lifelong soldier of the United States, so quickly betray it?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Lee fought for slavery</h4>
                <p>Robert Lee understood as well as any other contemporary the issue that ignited the secession crisis. Wealthy white plantation owners in the South had spent the better part of a century slowly taking over the United States government. With
                    each new political victory, they expanded human enslavement further and further until the oligarchs of the Cotton South were the wealthiest single group of people on the planet. It was a kind of power and wealth they were willing to
                    kill and die to protect. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Lee was not a military genius</h4>
                <p> Lee’s broader strategy was deeply flawed, and ended with his most infamous blunder. Lee should have recognized that the objective of his army was not to defeat the larger United States forces that he faced. Rather, he needed to simply
                    prevent those armies from taking Richmond, the city that housed the rebel government, until the United States government lost support for the war and sued for peace. New military technology that greatly favored defenders would have
                    bolstered this strategy. But Lee opted for a different strategy, taking his army and striking northward into areas that the United States government still controlled. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Lee, not Grant, was responsible for the staggering losses of the Civil War</h4>
                <p>Civil War enthusiasts often point to the resulting carnage as evidence that Ulysses S. Grant, the new General of the entire United States Army, did not care about the terrible losses and should be criticized for how he threw wave after
                    wave of men at entrenched rebel positions. In reality, however, the situation was completely of Lee’s making. As Grant doggedly pursued Lee’s forces, he did his best to flush Lee into an open field for a decisive battle, like at Antietam
                    or Gettysburg. Lee refused to accept, however, knowing that a crushing loss likely awaited him. Lee also could have abandoned the area around the rebel capital and allowed the United States to achieve a moral and political victory.
                    Both of these options would have drastically reduced the loss of life on both sides and ended the war earlier. Lee chose neither option. Rather, he maneuvered his forces in such a way that they always had a secure, defensive position,
                    daring Grant to sacrifice more men. When Grant did this and overran the rebel positions, Lee pulled back and repeated the process. The result was the most gruesome period of the war. </p>
